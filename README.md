A collection of info for the Datamedia DT80 terminal.

I found it in an area about 10 yards from a creek that floods from the creek when it rains. It was in bad shape.

Roms are toast, but I've included them anyways. I fixed the char rom, but the firmware roms are still toast. Until I can find a copy of the originals, I will have to
reverse engineer the terminal and write my own.
