The board renderer starts by looking at the board memory block as pointed to by the two variables 'brdU' and 'brdL'. This part of memory contains the tiles and their location; only three bytes are used here. char, X, Y

Each tile has serveral attributes that are located in a seperate block of memory whos start address is pointed to by the two variables 'tilatrU' and 'tilatrL'. Each tile is marked and ID'ed by it's first char pointer.

The tile attributes block of ram, or ROM, contains information such as, but not limited to:

> Tile character. 1 byte

> Tile dimensions to render and number of chars used. 1 byte, 4 bits for X, and 4 bits for total chars used.

> Game logic attributes. 1 byte

And more can be added if needed. Example:

> Number of animation frames. 1 byte, four bits are used.

> Animation frame delay in 1/60th of a second intervals.

> Animation last frame delay in 1/60th of a second intervals.

> Null char. 1 byte

And finally, a Second Null char to mark the end of the block.

Additionally, there can be live data stored in ram.

> Tile character start. 1 byte

> Animation timer. 1 byte

> Animation frame number. 1 byte

> Null char. 1 byte

A second Null char to mark the end of the block.
